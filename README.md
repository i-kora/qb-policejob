Modification of qb-policejob to make it work with sheriff (LSSD), also it add a full blips system, blue for police, green for sheriff, red for ems.

  - Blips: Change the blip if you are walking, on a car, on an helicopter or bike.
  - Moved blips logic to server side so they will update ven if out of the "scope".
  - You can see police and ems blips.
  - You should use  also qb-sheriffjob.
